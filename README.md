# Iris Dataset Analysis

This project explores the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) using **Python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.  
It demonstrates basic data exploration, descriptive statistics, grouping operations, and data visualizations.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `iris_analysis.py` → Python script with data loading, inspection, and analysis.
- `iris_analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with interactive exploration and visualizations.
- `README.md` → Documentation of the project.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Python Script
```bash
python iris_analysis.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
Open iris_analysis.ipynb on GitHub.
> ℹ If the notebook does not render properly on GitHub, you can open it via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading the file.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- Data inspection: dataset info, missing values check (none found).
- Descriptive statistics: summary of numerical features.
- Group by species: average measurements per Iris species.
- Visualizations:
  - Line chart: Sepal length and width trends.
  - Bar chart: Average petal length by species.
  - Histogram: Distribution of petal width.
  - Scatter plot: Sepal length vs petal length (colored by species).

## 🔍 Insights

- Setosa has significantly smaller petal length and width compared to other species.
- Virginica generally shows the largest values across features.
- No missing values were detected; the dataset is clean and consistent.
